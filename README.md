# Decentralized Synthetic Biology Marketplace

A blockchain-based platform for secure collaboration, trading, and verification of synthetic biology designs and genetic sequences.

## Overview

The Decentralized Synthetic Biology Marketplace enables researchers, organizations, and laboratories to safely collaborate on synthetic biology projects while ensuring proper licensing, safety compliance, and fair compensation for intellectual property. The platform leverages blockchain technology to create an immutable record of genetic designs, safety validations, and usage rights.

## Core Components

### Gene Sequence Contract
- Manages registration and ownership of novel gene sequences
- Handles licensing and usage rights
- Tracks sequence modifications and versions
- Implements secure storage of genetic data
- Manages access control and permissions

### Organism Design Contract
- Facilitates collaborative design of synthetic organisms
- Tracks contributions from multiple researchers
- Manages version control of designs
- Handles design validation and testing records
- Coordinates peer review processes

### Biosafety Verification Contract
- Implements automated safety checks
- Tracks regulatory compliance
- Records safety testing results
- Manages approval workflows
- Maintains audit trails of safety assessments

### Royalty Distribution Contract
- Calculates and distributes payments
- Tracks usage of genetic designs
- Manages licensing fee collection
- Handles revenue sharing among contributors
- Maintains payment histories

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16.0 or higher)
- IPFS node for genetic data storage
- Hardhat Development Environment
- Web3 wallet
- Access to approved biological research credentials

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/synbio-marketplace.git

# Install dependencies
cd synbio-marketplace
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings

# Deploy contracts
npx hardhat deploy --network <your-network>
```

### Configuration
1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
    - `IPFS_NODE_ADDRESS`: IPFS node for genetic data
    - `BIOSAFETY_API_KEY`: Safety verification service access
    - `REGULATORY_AUTHORITY_KEY`: Compliance verification access
    - `PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_KEY`: Financial transaction processing

2. Configure platform parameters in `config.js`:
    - Licensing terms
    - Safety requirements
    - Royalty calculations
    - Collaboration rules

## Usage

### Gene Sequence Management
```javascript
// Example of registering a new gene sequence
await geneSequence.registerSequence(
    sequenceData,
    metadata,
    ownershipProof,
    licenseTerms
);
```

### Organism Design
```javascript
// Example of creating a new organism design
await organismDesign.createDesign(
    components,
    specifications,
    safetyParameters,
    collaborators
);
```

### Safety Verification
```javascript
// Example of submitting for safety review
await biosafetyVerification.submitForReview(
    designId,
    safetyData,
    testResults,
    riskAssessment
);
```

### Royalty Management
```javascript
// Example of setting up royalty distribution
await royaltyDistribution.configureRoyalties(
    designId,
    contributors,
    percentages,
    paymentTerms
);
```

## Security Measures

### Data Protection
- Encrypted storage of genetic sequences
- Access control based on credentials
